## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We are leveraging a powerful combination of technologies to deliver accurate and fast results:

- **Gemini 1.5**: AI model for handling verification tasks.
- **Surya OCR**: OCR tool for document reading and data extraction.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
- **LangChain**: Cutting-edge tool for integrating AI models with vector databases using RAG.

## 🧠 Current Status

- **AI Models**: Currently testing **Gemini 1.5** for document verification accuracy.
- **OCR**: Initial tests are underway with **Surya OCR** for document reading.
- **Vector DB Pipelines**: Set up using **ChromaDB** to efficiently manage and retrieve embeddings.
- **LangChain Integration**: Implemented for a streamlined AI-document pipeline using **RAG**.

> 🚧 **Note**: Data ingestion is in progress, and model fine-tuning will be completed in upcoming phases.
